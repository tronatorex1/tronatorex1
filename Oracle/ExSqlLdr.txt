How to use Sql Loader
Note: sqlldr creates a real table. The External Table procedure doesn't create a real tabnle capable of DML or any ther activity except reading from it! It is faster but is does not allow modify its data stored.

1. Create a folder in which to store these following files. It may be c:\tmp. SqlLdr seems to be able to access this path. 

2. Create the 3 based files:
ctl
dat
par
as follows:

email.par:

userid=<user>@<SID>/<password>
control=email.ctl
log=email.log
bad=email.bad
data=email.dat
direct=true

email.ctl:

load data into table emails
insert
fields terminated by ","
(
email_id,
email
)

email.dat:

1,john.doe@example.com
2,jane.doe@example.com
3,peter.doe@example.com
4,xxx@xxxx.com

3. Then create a table to store this data:

CREATE TABLE emails(
    email_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR2(150) NOT NULL
);


4. And run:

C:\tmp>sqlldr userid=SYSTEM control=email.ctl data=email.dat
Password: <enter your pasword here>



It will display something like this:---
