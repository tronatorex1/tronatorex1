- 👋 Hi, I’m @tronatorex1
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python, Powershell, and many other languages 
- 🌱 I’m currently sharing a few code bits I believe may come in handy for some newbies like myself, who cannot easily find information or examples on how to do things...
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on any other projects... just to leave something that may be of help to someone
- 📫 I'm not reachable at the time

tronatorex1/tronatorex1 is a collection of EXAMPLES (not finished or definite) codes, that I hope may help people with syntax and other details related mostly to PS/Py/SS
DO NOT JUDGE MY CODES! I am not here to be judged. I am not a code-fashionista! 
If you find useful anything, use it! 
Otherwise, go and complaint to someone else ;)
