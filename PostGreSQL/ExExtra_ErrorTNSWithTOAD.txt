Notes:

Listener down error:
====================

Listener may be down and SQL*Plus allows users to connect. So testing with SQL*Plus is not the best way. Make sure the service is running (even when the service y up and lots of errors show up on the cmd console). Make sure to run the below commands from the Oracle path (search for lsnrctl.exe to find wheree binaries are located in your machine)

1. Start service: OracleOraD821Home1TNSListener
or
2. run at cmd (from any path):
$> lsnrctl stat
it should say that the listener is not running now

$> lsnrctl stop

$> lsnrctl start

Also create the ORACLE_HOME (addressing the oracle's bin path) var and TNS_ADMIN (addressing where listener exe resides)

Finally make sure your listener.ora looks something like:
"
# tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File: C:\Oracle\homes\OraDB21Home1\NETWORK\ADMIN\tnsnames.ora
# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

XE =
  (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.11)(PORT = 1521)) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE_NAME = XE)))

XEPDB1 =
  (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.11)(PORT = 1521)) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE_NAME = XEPDB1)))

LISTENER_XE =
  (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.11)(PORT = 1521)(SID = XE))

      (PRESENTATION = RO)
    )
  )

XEPDB1 and having the listeneer as a service up and running will allow to connect to the DB
